## [Unreleased]

### Added
- SwiftPM scaffold: `Core` (async filesystem provider, streamed cancellable listing) and
  `App` (SwiftUI dual-pane entry).
- Honest loading state: panes render "Reading… (N)" while a directory streams in.
- `App/Resources/Info.plist` (bundle id `com.yafm.app`) and `Scripts/make-app.sh` to wrap the
  SwiftPM binary into a real `.app` bundle.
- `ROADMAP.md` (status tracker) and this changelog.

### Fixed
- App launched faceless (no window) with `linkd.autoShortcut` / "missing main bundle
  identifier" warnings — caused by a bare SPM executable having no `CFBundleIdentifier`.
  Running from the generated `.app` bundle fixes it.
